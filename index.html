    <h2>Box office</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
    <br>
    <p>For the publication,see <a href="#"> BoxOffice (magazine)</a>.</p>
    <p>A box office or ticket office is a place where<a href="#"> tickets </a>are sold to the public for admission to an
        event. Patrons may perform the transaction at a <a href="#">countertop,</a> through a hole in a wall or window,
        or at a <a href="#"> wicket.</a> </p>
    <p>By extension, the term is frequently used, especially in the context of the film industry, as a synonym for the
        amount of business a particular production, such as a film or theatre show, receives.<a
            href="#"></a><sup>[1]</sup> <br>
        Box office business can be measured in the terms of the number of tickets sold or the amount of money raised by
        ticket sales (<a href="#">revenue</a>). The projection and analysis of these earnings is very important for the
        creative
        industries and often a source of interest for fans. This is predominant in the <a href="#"> Hollywood movie
            industry.</a>
        A folk etymology is that this derives from Elizabethan theatre (i.e. late 16th century), where theatre admission
        was collected in a box attached to a long stick, passed around the audience;<sup>[3]</sup> comparable to
        "bottle" in
        Punch and Judy,

  <h2> Etymology [<a href="#">Edit</a>] </h2>
    <p>The term is attested since 1786,<sup>[2]</sup> presumably from sales of boxes (private seating areas in a
        theatre).<sup>[3][4]</sup>
        The sense of "total sales" is attested from 1904.<sup>[2]</sup>

        A folk etymology is that this derives from Elizabethan theatre (i.e. late 16th century), where theatre admission
        was collected in a box attached to a long stick, passed around the audience;<sup>[3]</sup> comparable to
        "bottle" in
        Punch and Judy, where money was collected in a bottle. However, first attestation is about 200 years later,
        making this highly unlikely.</p>

    <h3>Box office reporting</h3>
    <p>There are numerous websites that monitor box-office receipts, such as <a href="#"> BoxOffice, Box Office India,
            Box Office
            Mojo, Koimoi, ShowBIZ</a> Data and The <a href="#">Numbers</a> which provide detailed information for many
        movies but have less and
        incomplete data for older movies due to the history of how box office reporting evolved, especially in the U.S.,
        and the availability of this information prior to the introduction of the internet.

        Although other publications have published box office data over the years, the longevity and regular reporting
        of Variety makes it a significant source for older box office reporting for the US market and US films.

        During the 1920s, <a href="#">Variety</a> reported box office grosses for films by theatre for certain U.S.
        cities.<sup>[6][7]</sup> In 1946,
        they started to publish a weekly National Box Office survey on page 3 indicating the performance of the week's
        hits and flops based on the box office results of 25 key U.S. cities.<sup>[6][7]</sup></p>
